# CL Prompt — Prompt IBM i CL Commands

This is a CL Prompter for VS CODE running the vscode-for-ibmi extension, commonly known as Code4i or Code4IBMi
To prompt a CL command, open a CLP or CLLE source member, place the cursor on the line with the command you want to prompt,
then press F4 or use the context ("right-click") menu if that's easier.
